'''Dunder Mifflin Scranton''' is a [[branch]] of the [[Dunder Mifflin Paper Company]] that is based out of [[Scranton]], Pennsylvania in Lackawanna County. It is located at 1725 Slough Avenue, Suite 200 in the [[Scranton Business Park]]. It is the main setting for the show ''[[The Office]]''.

As revealed in "[[Casino Night]]", the Dunder Mifflin Scranton [[warehouse]] - perhaps including the suite - is on a seven year lease from [[Beekman Properties]]. According to Dwight, the lease was on its fourth year at the time, which means the lease will end sometime during the year 2009 if not renewed. However, in "[[Branch Closing]]" it was revealed that [[Bob Vance]] of [[Vance Refrigeration]] was going to buy the warehouse.

==Office layout==
The Office is rearranged at times due to additional employees or employee relations.
This is the layout as of "[[Michael's Last Dundies]]"

[[File:Layout.jpg|thumb|center|500px]]

Pam's desk was designed to be round so she could swivel to look at any point in the office. Dwight and Jim's desks are angled relative to each other, rather than facing each other. Jim's desk does not face Pam's, but Pam can look directly at Jim. This means that Jim has to make a conscious choice to look at Pam, and he is either unaware that she's looking at him, or at least pretending to be unaware. It also allowed for shots to be framed so that both of their faces are visible. The show did take liberty to remove the partitions between desks, so that everyone could see each other.{{GreeneUntoldStoryCitation|4|Setting the Stage}}

Realistically, the layout of the office doesn't change much throughout the series:

* Two desks are added in "[[The Merger]]":
**One is added to [[Jim Halpert|Jim]] and [[Dwight Schrute|Dwight]]'s desk clump. His usual place occupied by [[Ryan Howard|Ryan]], Jim takes it.
**Another is added to [[Phyllis Vance|Phyllis]] and [[Stanley Hudson|Stanley]]'s desk clump. The new desk is occupied first by [[Karen Filippelli|Karen]], then by [[Andy Bernard|Andy]], then by [[Cathy Simms|Cathy]], and finally by [[Nellie Bertram|Nellie]].
*Jim's new desk is removed in "[[Fun Run]]", following Ryan's promotion and temporary departure from Scranton.
* It is added back and occupied by [[Pam Beesly|Pam]] starting with "[[Casual Friday]]".
* In "[[The Promotion]]", a new office is built where [[Creed Bratton|Creed]] and [[Devon White|Devon]]'s desk clump used to be. Creed takes [[Ryan Howard|Ryan]]'s old place, facing [[Meredith Palmer|Meredith]]. The office in question is used first by Jim, then by [[Darryl Philbin|Darryl]].

==Behind the scenes==
* The computers on the set were functional and starting in Season 2 had working Internet connections. Actors would play online games or deal with personal tasks on the computers between scenes.
* For legal reasons, the computer screens could show only the Dunder Mifflin wallpaper, fake office documents and email, and (for some reason) the game FreeCell.
* Oscar's computer was the only one with sound.
* The windows are all angled slightly downward, to avoid creating unwanted reflections. [https://www.reddit.com/r/DunderMifflin/comments/g2zx0m/small_thing_i_noticed_all_windows_inside_the/ Photo]
