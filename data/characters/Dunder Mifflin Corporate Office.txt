'''Dunder Mifflin Corporate Headquarters''' is the corporate office of the [[Dunder Mifflin Paper Company]]. It is located in New York City at 1345 Sixth Avenue between 54th and 55th Streets in the AllianceBernstein Building.<ref>Establishing shot in the episode "[[The Job]]".</ref>

It is shut down following Sabre's buyout of the company, however David Wallace buys Dunder Mifflin back from Sabre, meaning that a new corporate office is opened.
