Oscar attends [[Toby Flenderson|Toby]]'s sexual harassment meeting and is mostly seen in the background. ("[[Sexual Harassment]]")

During the fire, Oscar and the rest of the office staff stand around in the parking lot. When [[Jim Halpert|Jim]] suggests playing "who would you do" both [[Kevin Malone|Kevin]] and Oscar say [[Pam Beesly|Pam]]. Pam, [[Meredith Palmer|Meredith]] and [[Phyllis Vance|Phyllis]] all agree on Oscar in "who would you do." ("[[The Fire]]")

Oscar dresses as a woman during Halloween and when [[Michael Scott|Michael]] remarks that he is "showing his true colors" Oscar seems to get paranoid and asks what Michael is implying. When [[Angela Martin|Angela]] later discovers that the accounting department has more people than necessary and Michael has to fire someone, Oscar gets nervous. As he is later walking out of the bathroom, [[Ryan Howard|Ryan]] remarks that his dress is stuck in the back. Oscar is later invited to join [[Devon]] at Poor Richard's, which he accepts along with most of the office staff. ("[[Halloween]]")

When Michael and [[Jan Levinson|Jan]] leave to woo a potential major candidate Michael tells everyone goodbye but says "adios" to Oscar. When sitting in the break room the gang is talking about worst first dates and Oscar is heard saying "she" when talking about his horrible first date. In Michael's absence the staff decide to read the script to a screen play that Michael wrote. Oscar plays the villain [[Goldenface]]. ("[[The Client]]")

Oscar attends Michael's meeting on how to make the workplace better but has no lines throughout the whole episode. ("[[Performance Review]]")

Oscar asks Michael why he is spying on their computers, but Michael tries to convince the whole office that Oscar has lost it. Michael later asks Oscar where he is going and Oscar is able to get out of it by pointing out that he is on the phone. Oscar later goes to Jim's barbeque and talks to [[Stanley Hudson|Stanley]] about work. When [[Kelly Kapoor|Kelly]] asks that they all please talk about something else, an awkward silence goes between them. ("[[Email Surveillance]]")

Oscar reveals that he got [[Creed Bratton|Creed]] for Secret Santa, but doesn't know anything about him. However, Oscar believes that Creed might be Irish, so he got him a shamrock key chain ([[Christmas Party]]).

Oscar explains Michael's theme for last year's "retreat." ("[[Booze Cruise]]")

Oscar calls in sick, but Michael and Dwight call him believing that he might be playing hooky. Oscar sounds sick, but Dwight goes to spy on him. It turns out that Oscar was in fact playing hooky and was actually on a date with his boyfriend [[Gil]]. Dwight, not realizing that Oscar is secretly gay, tells Oscar that he won't tell Michael if he can hang out with them. Dwight later watches TV with them while Oscar and Gil hold hands behind his back. ("[[The Secret]]")

When Michael asks anyone if they want a souvenir from New York, Oscar tells Michael that the best present is for him to make a good impression in front of the new CFO. Michael assures him that he will. Oscar later gets flowers for Valentine's Day. When asked who they're from, Oscar replies his mom. ("[[Valentine's Day]]")

==Season 3==
Oscar and Gil go on a three-month vacation to Europe on [[Dunder Mifflin Paper Company|Dunder Mifflin]]'s tab after Michael accidentally outs him and, in an attempt to make Oscar feel better and show the rest of the employees that he is not homophobic, kisses Oscar in front of everyone in the conference room. He says he was planning to quit before he was given the time off. ("[[Gay Witch Hunt]]")

==Season 5==
Oscar continues to speak Spanish fluently, using it in "[[Stress Relief]]", where he rants about Michael at his roast.
He accompanies Michael and [[Andy Bernard|Andy]] to Canada in "[[Business Trip]]".

==Season 6==
In "[[Secret Santa]]", Oscar has a crush on another worker in the warehouse named [[Matt]], and [[Pam Beesly|Pam]] tries setting them up. 

In the episode "[[Happy Hour]]", Oscar shows up hours before the building even opens just to say hello to Matt. He suggests to [[Darryl Philbin|Darryl]] that the office and warehouse employees all go out for a happy hour after work, where Oscar tries to interact with Matt and the other warehouse guys. Darryl later tells Oscar that "Matt is a great guy, but he's a dummy" and that they have nothing in common.

==Season 7==
During the episode "[[Dwight K. Schrute, (Acting) Manager]]", Dwight makes the office recite the Pledge of Allegiance. Oscar is clearly shown to not say the line, 'One nation under God'. In that same episode Oscar is also disgusted by the fact that the carpet in the office covers up hardwood flooring.

==Season 8==
On his way into work, Oscar spots [[Erin Hannon|Erin]] planking in the parking lot and goes off on an angry rant telling the cameras that he finds planking to be both stupid and dangerous. Later in the episode, Oscar is seen on the left side of [[Robert California]]'s list of names. He is also one of the people invited out to lunch and later agrees with Robert's analysis of ''Sesame Street'' to appear more as one of Robert's favorites. ("[[The List]]")

Oscar is present during Dwight's meeting and is offended when he learns why Andy calls him "Cocker Spaniel". Andy also asks him which tie he should wear when he meets Robert. When Robert visits the Scranton Branch, Oscar is quick to hang up his phone along with everyone else and pretends to be busy. He later listens to Robert's speech and encourages Kevin not to add his thoughts into the conversation as he knows Kevin doesn't understand what is going on. Oscar is seen laughing and enjoying the sketches brought forward when the office is voting on what should be tattooed on Andy. He watches Andy get the tattoo later on. ("[[The Incentive]]")

==Season 9==
It is revealed that Oscar is having an affair with [[Angela Martin|Angela]]'s husband, [[Robert Lipton]]. Kevin later discovers this secret, and Oscar struggles to keep his secret with Angela. Meanwhile, Angela suspects that Robert is having an affair, and enlists Oscar to spy on him at his yoga class ("[[The Whale]]"). When Robert leaves, they catch him making a phone call, and Oscar's phone rings. Oscar takes his phone, looking at Angela, wondering if she discovered his secret. Later, Oscar is nervous coming into work because he doesn't know if Angela discovered the secret or not. He believes that she has not, but when Oscar is in a talking head, Angela is seen with a face of intense hatred. Later that day, Dwight surprises a confused Oscar and forces him to hide in the warehouse. He discovers, from Dwight and Angela, that they hired [[Trevor|somebody]] to break Oscar's knees for having an affair with Robert.

In the "[[Finale]]", it is seen that Oscar is running for state senator. It is also revealed that Oscar is the godfather of [[Philip Schrute]], Dwight and Angela's son.

* In "[[Email Surveillance]]", Oscar talks on the phone as he leaves work to avoid having to tell Michael where he's going.

Oscar inserts himself into a lot of conversations to add facts or correct grammar. He tends to use "actually" a lot when doing so.
* "Actually, I ran the numbers on this, and in this case it makes more financial sense to ''gain'' money." ("[[Body Language]]")
* "Actually, you're speculating." ("[[China]]")

==Quotes==

*"I'm an accountant at a failing paper company in Scranton."
