}}'''Val Johnson''' is hired as the warehouse foreman after the old warehouse staff quits. She is the former love interest of [[Glenn]] and [[Brandon]].

==History==
Val is hired to work as the warehouse foreman after the old staff quits after winning the lottery. [[Darryl]] and [[Gabe]] awkwardly try to flirt with her for most of the season in a similar way that [[Andy Bernard|Andy]] did with [[Erin Hannon|Erin]]. At first, Val has a boyfriend named [[Brandon]] who owns his own restaurant. Darryl and Val finally get together after Val breaks up with her boyfriend.

Darryl feels that the relationship has grown stale and decides to end it by planting the idea of breaking up in her head and putting on weight. When [[Kevin Malone|Kevin]], [[Phyllis Lapin-Vance|Phyllis]] and [[Nellie Bertram|Nellie]] discover that Val dumped Darryl, they blindside her and start praising Darryl. Val then gets back with Darryl, much to his chagrin.

She later appears at Dwight and Angela's wedding reception and is seen with Darryl in "[[Finale]]".
