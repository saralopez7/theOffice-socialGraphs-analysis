'''Dunder Mifflin Nashua''' is a [[branch]] of [[Dunder Mifflin Paper Company]] that is based out of Nashua, New Hampshire.

The first mention of the Nashua branch is in the episode "[[Local Ad]]" when [[Michael Scott]] is shown the Nashua branch's local commercial. The branch makes its first appearance in "[[Lecture Circuit Part 2]]" as one of the branches Michael and [[Pam Beesly]] make a presentation at.

The branch is also used as part of the plot of "[[Employee Transfer]]," where [[Holly Flax]] and Michael take a "road trip" after the CFO transfers Holly back to her old branch because of her relationship with Michael. Holly moves to Nashua during the episode.

In one of the deleted scenes from "[[Branch Wars]]", Michael lists a specific characteristic of each branch, explaining that Nashua has "no parking." Pam also mentions that "the branch is only accessible through cross country skiing" meaning that the branch is in a rural area.

We know very little about the staff members of the Nashua branch other than [[Holly Flax|Holly]]. In "[[Lecture Circuit Part 2]]", [[Pam Beesly|Pam]] makes up names for a few: "Blazer," "Freckles," "Penguin," and "K.D. Lang." The branch's regional manager, portrayed by actor James McElroy (also seen in the second-season episode "[[Booze Cruise]]") can be seen fairly clearly in the local commercial from "[[Local Ad]]".

In the episode "[[Survivor Man]]", [[Toby Flenderson]] mentions that a man named [[Mentioned Characters#Mark Chisholm|Mark Chisholm]] attended [[Ryan Howard]]'s wilderness retreat, indicating that Chisholm is a regional manager. It is possible that he is the regional manager of the Nashua branch, though he could just as well be the regional manager for [[Dunder Mifflin Rochester|Rochester]], [[Dunder Mifflin Akron|Akron]], [[Dunder Mifflin Camden|Camden]], or [[Dunder Mifflin Yonkers|Yonkers]].

==Trivia==
*The Nashua branch may have hired the first female HR worker of Dunder Mifflin since in the episode "[[The Dundies]]", Dwight mentions there not being any female HR workers for the company.
*It's possible that Nashua has more than one HR rep, seeing as how Holly is (twice) temporarily transferred to Scranton to replace Toby and it's unlikely that she wouldâ€™ve been asked to do that if she was the only HR rep at Nashua because then they would also have to find a replacement for her too.
