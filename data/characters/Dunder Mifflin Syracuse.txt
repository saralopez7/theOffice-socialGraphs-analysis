'''Dunder Mifflin Syracuse''' is a [[branch]] of the [[Dunder Mifflin Paper Company]] that is based in Syracuse, New York. They are almost a mirror image of the [[Scranton]] branch, as shown in a deleted scene. 

After the Binghamton branch closes, salesmen from both Syracuse and Scranton fight over who gets their clients in the episode "[[Turf War]]". [[Harry Jannerone]] confronts [[Jim Halpert|Jim]], [[Dwight Schrute|Dwight]], and [[Toby Flenderson|Toby]] (who is acting as fictional salesman [[Lloyd Gross]]) directly over these clients. 

Harry talks about how the staff at the Syracuse branch are way more fun than the Scranton branch in a deleted scene. The cameras then show several staff members that seem to be exact replicas of Scranton branch staff, only more boring.
