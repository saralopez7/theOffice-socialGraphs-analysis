==Behind the scenes==
Writer [[Mindy Kaling]] approached actor [[Rich Sommer]] when ''The Office'' and ''Mad Men'' were invited to the SAG awards and told him that she was writing a character with him in mind. Sommer was already a big fan of the show and was thrilled. He still had to audition for the part, but he felt confident that he would get it.{{OfficeLadiesCitation084|01:10}}

[[Alex]] was intended to be similar to [[Karen Filippelli]]: The character would stick around for an entire season and serve as a potential roadblock between Jim and Pam, although the affection in this case was one-sided.{{OfficeLadiesCitation084|03:01}} However, the fan response to the first episode was so strongly negative that the show quickly pivoted away from that story line: The already-filmed scenes from "[[Business Ethics]]" with Alex were deleted. The show was filming "[[Customer Survey]]" at the time "[[Weight Loss]]" aired, and the scene between Pam and Alex was rewritten from a profession of love to encouragement for Pam to stay in New York and pursue her dream.<ref>Matheson, Whitney.

Rich Sommer is still recognized as his Office character. During his story line, he was on an airplane and a passenger yelled at him angrily, "Don't f&mdash; with Pam and Jim!"{{OfficeLadiesCitation084|10:23}}
