In the episode "[[The Fight]]", [[Jim Halpert|Jim]] mentions that the Albany branch is working through lunch in an attempt to avoid downsizing.

The first known staff member of Dunder Mifflin Albany was [[Craig]], the Regional Manager. He is seen in the episode "[[Valentine's Day]]". At one point, he mentions that [[Jan Levinson|Jan]] had told him to fire four people, but he simply ignored her.

In "[[Beach Games]]" Oscar says that if any of Michael's candidates for manager become manager he will transfer to Albany.

In the episode "[[Survivor Man]]", [[Toby Flenderson|Toby]] mentions having gone camping with [[Mentioned Characters#Jeff|Jeff]] from Albany. This could either mean that Craig was replaced by Jeff as Regional Manager or simply that Jeff is an employee in another position there.

Little else is known about this branch of the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In the deleted scenes of "[[Branch Wars]]" [[Michael Scott|Michael]] explains a specific characteristic of each branch, explaining that Albany are "the prepsters."

In a deleted scene from "[[Stress Relief]]", the Albany branch is said to be closing.

Even though in the episode "[[Company Picnic]]" representatives from Albany are present at the picnic.
